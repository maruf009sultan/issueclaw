## 🤔 What is IssueClaw?

IssueClaw is an **AI assistant that lives inside your GitHub repo**. You talk to it by opening issues. It responds by commenting. It remembers everything. It can even edit your code.

**No servers. No databases. No monthly bills.** Just GitHub Issues + GitHub Actions + your favorite LLM API.

### The magic in 30 seconds

```
1. You open an issue: "Build me a portfolio site"
2. IssueClaw reacts with 👀 (it's working!)
3. IssueClaw creates the files, commits them to your repo
4. IssueClaw replies as a comment: "Done! Here's what I built..."
5. You comment back: "Add a dark mode toggle"
6. IssueClaw remembers the whole conversation and edits the files
```

**Total cost: $0/month** with Groq or Gemini's free tier.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Fork & clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maruf009sultan/issueclaw.git
cd issueclaw
```

### Step 2: Get a FREE API key

Pick one (or more):

| Provider | Free? | Get Key | Best for |
|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Groq** | ✅ | https://console.groq.com/keys | Quick chat (default mode) |
| **Gemini** | ✅ | https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey | Full agent mode (file editing) |
| **Cerebras** | ✅ | https://inference.cerebras.ai/ | Fast agent mode |
| **OpenRouter** | ✅ | https://openrouter.ai/keys | Many free models |

### Step 3: Add the key as a GitHub secret

In your forked repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

- Name: `GROQ_API_KEY` (or `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, etc.)
- Value: your API key

### Step 4: Enable Actions

Go to the **Actions** tab → click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**

### Step 5: Open an issue! 🎉

That's it! Open an issue and IssueClaw responds automatically.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

IssueClaw has **two modes**:

### 💬 Chat Mode (default)

Open an issue with **no label** → IssueClaw responds directly, like ChatGPT.

- Uses ~500 tokens per message
- Works perfectly with **Groq's free tier** (12K TPM)
- Perfect for: questions, explanations, quick help

### 🤖 Agent Mode

Open an issue with the **`agent`** label → IssueClaw becomes a full coding agent.

- Can read files, edit files, run bash, commit to your repo
- Uses ~120,000 tokens per message
- Needs **Gemini** (1M TPM) or **Cerebras** (60K TPM) — Groq can't handle it
- Perfect for: "Build me a website", "Fix this bug", "Add a README"

### 🥚 Hatch Mode

Open an issue with the **`hatch`** label → bootstrap IssueClaw's personality.

IssueClaw will have a conversation with you to figure out its name, vibe, and emoji. Stored in `state/personality.md` — persists forever via git.

---

## 📖 The Story

### The problem

AI assistants are great, but they have problems:

- **They're expensive** — ChatGPT Plus is $20/month, Copilot is $10/month
- **They forget everything** — close the tab, lose the context
- **They can't touch your code** — copy-paste workflow is painful
- **They need servers** — self-hosting means Docker, GPUs, config

### The idea

What if your AI assistant lived **inside your GitHub repo**? What if:

- You talk to it by **opening issues** (infrastructure you already have)
- It **remembers everything** because conversations are committed to git
- It **edits your code directly** and pushes commits
- It runs on **GitHub Actions** (free for public repos)
- It uses **free LLM APIs** (Groq, Gemini, Cerebras)

### The origin

This project builds on two brilliant predecessors:

1. **[gitclaw](https://github.com/SawyerHood/gitclaw)** by [Sawyer Hood](https://github.com/SawyerHood) — the original idea of an AI agent that lives in GitHub Issues. Sawyer's creativity sparked this whole concept.

2. **[pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono)** by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/badlogic) — the production-grade coding agent CLI (v0.80.3) that powers the agent mode. Mario built the entire agent loop, tool system, and multi-provider support.

IssueClaw takes these foundations and adds:

- ✅ **Multi-provider support** — 8 LLM providers with automatic fallback
- ✅ **Two modes** — chat (saves 99% of tokens) + agent (full tools)
- ✅ **Persistent memory** — git-backed, survives forever
- ✅ **Production-grade** — 122 tests, audit trail, concurrency control
- ✅ **Free to run** — $0/month with Groq/Gemini free tiers

### Why "IssueClaw"?

Because it **claws into your issues** and gets things done. 🦃

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 💬 Quick Chat (Groq, free)

Open an issue, no label:
- "What's the capital of France?"
- "Explain how async/await works"
- "What's the BTC price right now?"

IssueClaw responds in ~5 seconds, using ~500 tokens.

### 🤖 Code Tasks (Gemini/Cerebras, free)

Open an issue with `agent` label:
- "Build me a 3-file portfolio site"
- "Fix the bug in src/main.ts"
- "Add a README to this repo"
- "Create a GitHub Actions workflow"

IssueClaw creates/edits files, commits to git, and replies.

### 🥚 Personalize (any provider)

Open an issue with `hatch` label:
- IssueClaw asks: "Who am I? Who are you?"
- You decide its name, vibe, emoji
- Stored in `state/personality.md` forever

### 📝 Long Conversations

Comment on an existing issue → IssueClaw resumes with full context. It remembers everything said before in that issue thread.

## 🛠️ Features at a Glance

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| 💬 Simple chat mode (saves 99% of tokens) | ✅ |
| 🤖 Full agent mode (bash, edit, read, write, grep) | ✅ |
| 🧠 Persistent memory (git-backed) | ✅ |
| 🎭 Custom personality (hatch flow) | ✅ |
| 🔄 Multi-provider fallback (8 providers) | ✅ |
| 🔒 Permission checks (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLAB only) | ✅ |
| ⚡ Concurrency control (no race conditions) | ✅ |
| 📋 Audit logging (JSON trail) | ✅ |
| 🐳 Docker support | ✅ |
| 🧪 122 tests (unit + integration + live) | ✅ |
| 🆓 $0/month with free tiers | ✅ |

---

## 📊 Token Usage

| Mode | Tokens/message | Works with Groq? | Works with Gemini? |
|------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 💬 Chat (default) | ~500 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| 🤖 Agent (`agent` label) | ~120,000 | ❌ No (413 error) | ✅ Yes |
| 🥚 Hatch (`hatch` label) | ~120,000 | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Rule of thumb:** Use chat mode (default) for questions. Use agent mode only for code tasks, and only with Gemini/Cerebras.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

IssueClaw auto-generates its config on first run. To manually generate:

```bash
bun run src/cli.ts config auto
```

This detects which API keys you have and builds the optimal config. Edit `issueclaw.config.json` to customize.

### Providers (pick one or more)

| Secret | Provider | Free? |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq | ✅ |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini | ✅ |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` | Cerebras | ✅ |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter | ✅ |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic | ❌ |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI | ❌ |

---

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

### "413 Token limit exceeded"

You're using agent mode with Groq. Agent mode needs ~120K tokens, but Groq's free tier is 12K TPM.

**Fix:** Either use chat mode (no label), or set `GEMINI_API_KEY` for agent mode.

### "Provider requires API_KEY"

The secret isn't set. Go to **Settings → Secrets → Actions** and add it.

### Agent doesn't respond

1. Check the **Actions** tab — did the workflow run?
2. Are you `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`?
3. Run `bun run src/cli.ts doctor` locally

## 🤔 What Is This?

**IssueClaw** is a **self-hosted AI assistant** that runs entirely through **GitHub Issues and GitHub Actions**. There is no server to deploy, no database to manage, no monthly cloud bill. The agent wakes up when you open an issue, does its work in a GitHub Actions runner, commits all state back to your repo, and replies as a comment.

It's built on top of [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) v0.80.3 — a production-grade coding agent CLI with tool use, session management, and multi-provider support.

### The problem we solve

| Problem | IssueClaw Solution |
|---------|---------------------------|
| AI assistants are expensive (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro) | **$0/month** with Gemini's free tier (1M TPM) |
| AI assistants forget everything between sessions | **Persistent memory** committed to git — survives forever |
| AI assistants can't edit your code | **Full agent mode** with bash, file editing, git access |
| AI assistants require servers/infrastructure | **Zero infrastructure** — runs in GitHub Actions |
| AI assistants don't have personality | **Mutable identity** via `personality.md` — bootstrap with `hatch` label |
| AI chatbots waste tokens on system prompts | **Simple chat mode** uses ~500 tokens (vs ~120K for agents) |
| AI APIs have rate limits | **Multi-provider fallback chain** — if one fails, try the next |

### The quick comparison

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Where does the agent run?** | In GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest runner) |
| **Where does it store memory?** | In your git repo, under `state/` |
| **How do I talk to it?** | Open a GitHub issue, or comment on one |
| **How does it remember me?** | Every session is committed to git; future sessions read prior state |
| **What LLMs does it support?** | Gemini (free, 1M TPM), Cerebras (free), OpenRouter (free models), Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| **Is it production-ready?** | Yes — 122 tests passing, structured logging, retry logic, audit trail, concurrency control |
| **Can random internet people trigger it?** | No — only `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR` can |
| **Cost?** | $0 with Gemini's free tier. GitHub Actions is free for public repos. |
| **Can it edit files in my repo?** | Yes — in agent mode, it has bash, read, write, edit, grep, glob, ls tools |
| **Can I just chat without the agent?** | Yes — use the "chat" label for simple Q&A (saves 99% of API tokens) |

### What it looks like in practice

```
1. You open an issue: "Set up a GitHub Pages site for this repo"
        ↓
2. Within seconds, the agent reacts with 👀 on your issue
        ↓
3. The agent runs in Actions, reads your repo, edits files,
   and commits everything to git
        ↓
4. It replies as a comment on the issue with what it did
        ↓
5. The 👀 reaction is removed
        ↓
6. Next time you comment on that issue, it resumes the SAME
   session with full prior context — it remembers everything
```

Or, for simple chat:

```
1. You open an issue with the "chat" label: "What's the capital of France?"
        ↓
2. The agent reacts with 👀
        ↓
3. A lightweight LLM call is made (no agent, no tools — saves API quota)
        ↓
4. The agent replies: "The capital of France is Paris."
        ↓
5. The 👀 reaction is removed
        ↓
6. Cost: ~500 tokens (vs ~120,000 for full agent mode)
```

## ✨ Features

### Enterprise-Grade Features

#### 🔄 Multi-Provider LLM Support
IssueClaw supports **8 LLM providers** out of the box, with automatic fallback:

- **🔵 Google Gemini** — 1,000,000 TPM free tier (recommended default)
- **⚡ Cerebras** — 60,000 TPM, ultra-fast (1000+ tokens/sec)
- **🔵 OpenRouter** — access to hundreds of models, many free
- **⚡ Groq** — 12,000 TPM, fast inference
- **🟣 Anthropic** — Claude Opus 4, Sonnet 4.5 (paid)
- **🟢 OpenAI** — GPT-4o, o1, o3 (paid)
- **🦙 Ollama** — local LLMs (self-hosted, free)
- **🔧 Custom** — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Azure, Together, vLLM, LM Studio, etc.)

#### ⛓️ Provider Fallback Chain
When one provider fails (rate limit, network error, quota exceeded), the agent **automatically tries the next provider** in the chain. You configure the order in `issueclaw.config.json`:

```json
{
  "providers": [
    { "type": "gemini", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash", "default": true },
    { "type": "cerebras", "model": "llama-3.3-70b" },
    { "type": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free" },
    { "type": "groq", "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" }
  ]
}
```

If Gemini fails → tries Cerebras → tries OpenRouter → tries Groq. The error message shows **all** provider attempts, so you know exactly what happened.

#### 🧠 Persistent Memory
The agent has **four types of persistent state**, all committed to git:

| File | Purpose | Mutability |
|------|---------|------------|
| `state/memory.md` | Append-only log of important facts, decisions, preferences | Append-only |
| `state/personality.md` | Agent identity (name, vibe, emoji, hatch date) | Mutable |
| `state/user.md` | User profile (name, preferences, communication style) | Mutable |
| `state/audit.log` | JSON audit trail of every agent run | Append-only |

At the start of every session, the agent's prompt is built from:
1. `state/personality.md` — who the agent is
2. `state/user.md` — what the agent knows about you
3. Last 20 lines of `state/memory.md` — recent durable facts
4. The issue title + body — what you're asking now
5. Operating instructions

#### 📋 Audit Logging
Every agent run is logged as JSON to `state/audit.log`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-07-07T10:30:00.000Z",
  "action": "agent_run_complete",
  "details": {
    "issue": 5,
    "success": true,
    "durationMs": 45230,
    "provider": "gemini",
    "responseLength": 1847
  }
}
```

You can query it with `jq`:

```bash
# Recent activity
tail -5 state/audit.log | jq .

# All errors
jq 'select(.details.success == false)' state/audit.log

# Runs per issue
jq -s 'group_by(.details.issue) | map({issue: .[0].details.issue, count: length})' state/audit.log
```

#### 🔒 Permission Checks
Only users with `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR` association on the repo can trigger the agent. This is enforced in **two places**:

1. **Workflow `if:` condition** (in `.github/workflows/agent.yml`)
2. **`shouldProcessEvent()` in code** (`src/github/events.ts`)

Random internet users **cannot** trigger the agent on public repos. Bots (`github-actions[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`) are also rejected to prevent infinite loops.

#### ⚡ Concurrency Control
The workflow uses GitHub's `concurrency` groups to serialize runs per issue:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

This means: if you comment on issue #5 three times in rapid succession, those three runs happen **sequentially**, not in parallel. This prevents git push conflicts and ensures session state is consistent.

#### 🔄 Retry with Backoff
All network operations use **exponential backoff with jitter**:

- Initial delay: 1 second
- Multiplier: 2x
- Max delay: 30 seconds
- Max attempts: 3 (configurable)
- Jitter: random 0-50% of delay

This handles transient network errors, rate limits, and 5xx server errors gracefully.

#### 📊 Session Artifacts
Every workflow run uploads `state/` and the raw agent JSONL output as a GitHub Actions artifact, retained for **30 days**. Download from the Actions tab → click a run → scroll to "Artifacts".

#### ⏱️ Timeouts
Two layers of timeout protection prevent runaway runs:

- **Job timeout**: 30 minutes (in workflow `timeout-minutes`)
- **Agent timeout**: 15 minutes (configurable in `agent.timeoutMs`)

#### 🐳 Docker Support
Containerized for local development parity with CI:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm issueclaw doctor
```

The `Dockerfile` uses `oven/bun:1.1-debian` and installs `git`, `gh`, `curl`, `jq`, `ripgrep`.

#### 🧪 Comprehensive Tests
**122 tests** across three layers:

| Layer | Count | What it tests |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Unit tests | 99 | Individual modules (config, providers, memory, github, agent, utils, simple-chat) |
| Integration tests | 4 | Full lifecycle with mocked pi |
| Live tests | 29 | End-to-end pipeline with real pi + mock LLM server |

#### 🔍 Structured Logging
Two output modes:

**Human-readable (default in TTY):**
```
[2026-07-07T10:30:00.000Z] INFO  [issueclaw] agent run succeeded {"provider":"gemini/gemini-2.0-flash","durationMs":45230}
```

**JSON (for log aggregation — set `ISSUECLAW_LOG_JSON=true`):**
```json
{"ts":"2026-07-07T10:30:00.000Z","level":"info","component":"issueclaw","msg":"agent run succeeded","provider":"gemini/gemini-2.0-flash","durationMs":45230}
```

Log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`.

#### 🛠️ CLI Tool
Full CLI for local testing and management:

```bash
issueclaw doctor          # Diagnose environment & config
issueclaw config auto     # Auto-generate config from env
issueclaw config show     # Print current config
issueclaw config validate # Validate config

### Original IssueClaw Features (Preserved & Enhanced)

The original [issueclaw](https://github.com/SawyerHood/issueclaw) by Sawyer Hood had these features — all preserved and enhanced:

- **💬 Issue-Driven** — open an issue → agent processes → replies as comment
- **🔁 Session Resume** — comment on existing issue → agent resumes with full context
- **📝 Git-Backed State** — all state in `state/` directory, committed to git
- **👀 Eyes Reaction** — agent reacts with 👀 while working, removes when done
- **🥚 Hatch Flow** — bootstrap agent identity via `hatch` label
- **🔍 Self-Search** — agent can grep its own conversation history
- **🎨 Personality** — mutable identity stored in `state/personality.md`

---

### NEW: Simple Chat Mode

**The killer feature for saving API quota.**

The full agent mode uses ~120,000 tokens per message (pi's system prompt + tool definitions + context). That blows past free-tier limits on Groq (12K TPM) and even strains Cerebras (60K TPM).

**Simple chat mode** bypasses the agent entirely and calls the LLM API directly:

| Metric | Full Agent Mode | Simple Chat Mode | Savings |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Tokens per message | ~120,000 | ~500 | **99.6% reduction** |
| Tools available | bash, edit, read, grep, etc. | None | — |
| File editing | Yes | No | — |
| Session resume | Yes (JSONL) | No (stateless) | — |
| Use case | Code tasks, file edits | Quick Q&A, questions | — |

**How to use it:** Open an issue with the **"chat"** label (or use the "💬 Chat" issue template). The agent will respond directly without using tools — perfect for questions like "What's the capital of France?" or "Explain how X works."

The simple chat mode still:
- ✅ Saves to `state/audit.log`
- ✅ Commits state changes to git
- ✅ Posts a comment on the issue
- ✅ Uses the provider fallback chain
- ✅ Includes personality + recent memory in the system prompt

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Fork & clone

```bash
# Fork https://github.com/maruf009sultan/issueclaw on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/maruf009sultan/issueclaw.git
cd issueclaw
```

### Step 2: Get a FREE API key

**Option A: Google Gemini (RECOMMENDED — 1M TPM)**

1. Go to **https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey**
2. Sign in with Google
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the key (starts with `AIza...`)

> **Why Gemini?** 1,000,000 tokens per minute free tier — 83x higher than Groq. Perfect for AI agents with large system prompts and tool definitions.

**Option B: Cerebras (free, ultra-fast)**

1. Go to **https://inference.cerebras.ai/**
2. Sign up
3. Generate an API key (starts with `csk_...`)

**Option C: OpenRouter (has free models)**

1. Go to **https://openrouter.ai/keys**
2. Sign up
3. Generate an API key (starts with `sk-or-v1-...`)

**Option D: Groq (free, but low 12K TPM)**

1. Go to **https://console.groq.com/keys**

You can set multiple keys — the agent uses them as a fallback chain.

### Step 3: Add the key(s) as GitHub secrets

In your forked repo:

1. Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"** for each key you have:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (recommended)
   - `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (paid)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (paid)

### Step 4: Enable Actions

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repo
2. If you see a banner saying "Workflows aren't being run on forked repositories", click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**

### Step 5: Open an issue 🎉

**For a quick chat:**
- Use the **"💬 Chat"** issue template
- Or open an issue and add the `chat` label

**For code tasks:**
- Use the **"🔧 Task"** issue template
- Or just open a regular issue

Within ~10 seconds:
- The agent will react with 👀
- The `IssueClaw Agent` workflow will start in the Actions tab
- After ~30-60 seconds, the agent will reply as a comment
- The 👀 reaction will be removed

**That's it. You now have a free, self-hosted AI assistant living in your repo.**

### Step 6 (optional): Hatch the agent's personality

Use the **"🥚 Hatch"** issue template to bootstrap the agent's identity. The agent will have a conversation with you to figure out its name, vibe, and emoji — all stored in `state/personality.md` and persisted via git.

### The Lifecycle: Step by Step

#### 1. You open an issue (or comment on one)
- GitHub fires a webhook → triggers the `IssueClaw Agent` workflow
- The workflow's `if:` condition checks your `author_association` is `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`
- Bots (`github-actions[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, etc.) are rejected — prevents infinite loops

#### 2. `preinstall.ts` runs
- Parses the GitHub event payload (`GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`)
- Adds 👀 reaction to the issue or comment (visual feedback that the agent is working)
- Writes reaction state to `/tmp/reaction-state.json` for cleanup later

#### 3. `bun install` runs
- Installs `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and dependencies
- Cached across runs via `actions/cache`

#### 4. `main.ts` runs — the main event
- Initializes `MemoryStore` (creates `state/memory.md`, `personality.md`, `user.md` with defaults if missing)
- Configures git identity (`issueclaw[bot]`)
- **Detects mode** based on issue labels:
  - `chat` label → **simple chat mode** (lightweight LLM call, ~500 tokens)
  - `hatch` label → **agent mode** + bootstrap identity flow
  - no special label → **full agent mode** (pi agent with tools, ~120K tokens)
- Checks for existing session mapping in `state/issues/<N>.json`

**If simple chat mode:**
- Builds a minimal system prompt (~200 tokens) with personality + recent memory
- Calls the LLM API directly (no pi, no tools)
- Provider fallback chain: Gemini → Cerebras → OpenRouter → Groq → ...
- Returns response (~500 tokens total)

**If agent mode:**
- **Builds the prompt** — combines:
  - `state/personality.md` (agent identity)
  - `state/user.md` (user profile)
  - Last 20 lines of `state/memory.md` (recent memory)
  - The issue title + body (or comment body) — with template boilerplate stripped
  - Operating instructions
  - Hatch trigger (if `hatch` label present)
- **Token budget enforcement**: if prompt > 6,000 tokens, progressively strips context
- **Runs pi** with the provider fallback chain
- Pi makes an HTTP call to the LLM API, streams back a response as JSONL
- Extracts the final **assistant** message from the JSONL (never the user message — that was a bug we fixed)
- Saves the session mapping (`state/issues/<N>.json` → `state/sessions/<timestamp>.jsonl`)

**In both modes:**
- **Commits everything to git**: `git add -A && git commit -m "issueclaw: work on issue #N (mode)" && git push`
  - If push fails (race condition), auto-rebases and retries up to 3 times
- **Posts a comment** on the issue with the agent's response
  - If response > 60,000 chars, truncates with a notice pointing to the session file
  - If agent failed, posts a **detailed error comment** with all provider attempts and troubleshooting hints
- In a `finally` block, removes the 👀 reaction

#### 5. Workflow uploads `state/` as an artifact (30-day retention) for debugging

### Two Modes: Agent vs. Simple Chat

| Aspect | Agent Mode | Simple Chat Mode |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Trigger** | Default (no label) or `hatch` label | `chat` label |
| **Tokens per message** | ~120,000 | ~500 |
| **Tools** | bash, read, edit, write, grep, glob, ls | None |
| **File editing** | Yes | No |
| **Session resume** | Yes (JSONL transcripts) | No (stateless) |
| **Use case** | Code tasks, file edits, complex work | Quick Q&A, questions |
| **API quota impact** | High | Minimal |
| **Speed** | 30-120 seconds | 2-10 seconds |

**When to use which:**
- **Simple chat**: "What's the capital of France?", "Explain how async/await works", "What's the weather API format?"
- **Agent mode**: "Create a hello world HTML page", "Fix the bug in src/main.ts", "Add a README to this repo"

### Concurrency Model

The workflow uses GitHub's `concurrency` groups to serialize runs per issue:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

This means: if you comment on issue #5 three times in rapid succession, those three runs happen **sequentially**, not in parallel. The second run waits for the first to finish, then starts. This prevents:
- Git push conflicts
- Session state corruption
- Race conditions in state commits

## 🔧 Configuration (Complete Reference)

IssueClaw is configured via `issueclaw.config.json`. The config is **auto-generated** on first run if it doesn't exist — it detects which API keys you have and builds the right config.

### Auto-Config (Recommended)

```bash
# Locally:
bun run src/cli.ts config auto

# Or just run the agent — config is auto-generated on first run
```

This detects `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment and builds a config with the right providers + fallback chain. Priority: Gemini (1M TPM) → Cerebras → OpenRouter → Groq → Anthropic → OpenAI.

### Config Sources

Configuration is loaded from (in priority order):

1. **Environment variables** (`ISSUECLAW_*`) — highest priority
2. **Config file** (`issueclaw.config.json` or `ISSUECLAW_CONFIG_PATH`)
3. **Legacy** (`.pi/settings.json`) — backward compatibility with original issueclaw
4. **Auto-generated** (on first run if no config exists)
5. **Built-in defaults**

## 🤖 Providers (Complete Guide)

IssueClaw supports **8 provider types** out of the box. **Gemini is the recommended default** because it has 1M TPM free tier (83x higher than Groq).

### Provider Comparison Table

| Provider | Type | API Key Env | Free Tier? | TPM Limit | Context Window | Notes |
|----------|------|-------------|------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **🔵 Gemini** | `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | **1,000,000** | 1,048,576 | **RECOMMENDED** — best for AI agents |
| **⚡ Cerebras** | `cerebras` | `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | 60,000 | 131,072 | Ultra-fast (1000+ tok/s) |
| 🔵 OpenRouter | `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | ✅ Free models | varies | varies | Access to hundreds of models |
| ⚡ Groq | `groq` | `GROQ_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | 12,000 | 131,072 | Low TPM — last resort |
| 🟣 Anthropic | `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | ❌ | — | 200,000 | Claude Opus 4, Sonnet 4.5 |
| 🟢 OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ❌ | — | 128,000 | GPT-4o, o1, o3 |
| 🦙 Ollama | `ollama` | (none) | ✅ Self-hosted | — | varies | Local LLMs |
| 🔧 Custom | `custom` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | varies | — | varies | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

### Google Gemini (Recommended)

**Get a free key**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

**Free tier limits** (as of 2026):
- Gemini 2.0 Flash: 15 RPM, 1,000,000 TPM, 1,500 requests/day
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: 10 RPM, 1,000,000 TPM, 500 requests/day
- Gemini 1.5 Flash: 15 RPM, 1,000,000 TPM, 1,500 requests/day

The **1,000,000 TPM** is what makes Gemini ideal for AI agents. Pi's system prompt + tool definitions = ~120K tokens, which Groq's 12K TPM literally cannot handle. Gemini handles it with room to spare.

**Available models:**
- `gemini-2.0-flash` (default — fast, capable)
- `gemini-2.5-flash` (better reasoning)
- `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` (faster, cheaper)
- `gemini-1.5-flash`
- `gemini-1.5-pro`
- `gemini-2.5-pro`

**Config:**
```json
{
  "type": "gemini",
  "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
  "apiKey": "${GEMINI_API_KEY}",
  "default": true
}
```

Pi has **native Gemini support** — uses `--provider google` which reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` automatically.

### Cerebras

**Get a free key**: https://inference.cerebras.ai/

**Free tier limits**: ~30 RPM, 60,000 TPM

Cerebras uses custom LPU hardware for ultra-fast inference (1000+ tokens/sec). Good fallback when Gemini is unavailable.

**Available models:**
- `llama-3.3-70b`
- `llama-3.1-8b`
- `gpt-oss-120b`
- `zai-glm-4.7`

**Config:**
```json
{
  "type": "cerebras",
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b",
  "apiKey": "${CEREBRAS_API_KEY}"
}
```

### OpenRouter

**Get a free key**: https://openrouter.ai/keys

OpenRouter routes to hundreds of models from many providers. Many models have free tiers.

**Recommended free models:**
- `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` (reliably available)
- `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` (sometimes rate-limited)
- `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it:free`

**Config:**
```json
{
  "type": "openrouter",
  "model": "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free",
  "apiKey": "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}"
}
```

### Groq

**Get a free key**: https://console.groq.com/keys

**Free tier limits**: 30 RPM, 12,000 TPM, 14,400 requests/day

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Groq's 12K TPM is too low for full agent mode (which needs ~120K tokens per message). Use Groq only as a last-resort fallback, or use it with simple chat mode.

**Available models:**
- `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- `mixtral-8x7b-32768`
- `gemma2-9b-it`

**Config:**
```json
{
  "type": "groq",
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "apiKey": "${GROQ_API_KEY}"
}
```

### Anthropic

**Get a key**: https://console.anthropic.com/ (paid)

**Models:**
- `claude-opus-4-6` (most capable)
- `claude-sonnet-4-5`
- `claude-haiku-4-5` (fastest)

**Config:**
```json
{
  "type": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "apiKey": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}",
  "thinking": "high"
}
```

### OpenAI

**Get a key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (paid)

**Models:**
- `gpt-4o`
- `gpt-4o-mini`
- `o1`
- `o3`

**Config:**
```json
{
  "type": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "apiKey": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
}
```

### Ollama (Local)

**Install Ollama**: https://ollama.ai/

**Models:**
- `llama3.1:70b`
- `qwen2.5:32b`
- `deepseek-r1:32b`

**Config:**
```json
{
  "type": "ollama",
  "model": "llama3.1:70b",
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434"
}
```

No API key required — runs locally on your machine.

### Custom (Any OpenAI-Compatible)

Any OpenAI-compatible API works via the `custom` provider type:

**Together AI:**
```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.together.xyz/v1",
  "apiKey": "${TOGETHER_API_KEY}"
}
```

**Azure OpenAI:**
```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "baseUrl": "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/your-deployment",
  "apiKey": "${AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}",
  "headers": { "api-key": "${AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}" }
}
```

**vLLM (local):**
```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B",
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
  "apiKey": "dummy"
}
```

**LM Studio:**
```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "model": "local-model",
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:1234/v1",
  "apiKey": "lm-studio"
}
```

### Provider Fallback Chain

Providers are tried in order. The first one marked `default: true` is the primary; others are fallbacks.

```json
{
  "providers": [
    { "type": "gemini", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash", "apiKey": "${GEMINI_API_KEY}", "default": true },
    { "type": "cerebras", "model": "llama-3.3-70b", "apiKey": "${CEREBRAS_API_KEY}" },
    { "type": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free", "apiKey": "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}" }
  ]
}
```

If Gemini fails → tries Cerebras → tries OpenRouter. The error message shows **all** provider attempts with their status.

### Adding Custom Providers

You can register custom providers at runtime via pi extensions:

```typescript
// .pi/extensions/my-provider.ts
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  pi.registerProvider("my-provider", {
    name: "My Provider",
    baseUrl: "https://api.example.com",
    apiKey: "$MY_API_KEY",
    api: "openai-completions",
    models: [
      {
        id: "my-model",
        name: "My Model",
        reasoning: false,
        input: ["text"],
        cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 },
        contextWindow: 128000,
        maxTokens: 4096,
      },
    ],
  });
}
```

## 💾 State & Persistence

**Yes — the GitHub repo itself is the database.** Everything the agent learns, creates, or modifies is committed to git. There is no external database, no S3 bucket, no Redis cache. Just your repo.

### What Gets Saved

```
state/
├── memory.md           ← 📝 Append-only memory log
├── personality.md      ← 🎭 Mutable agent identity
├── user.md             ← 👤 User profile
├── audit.log           ← 📋 JSON audit trail (one line per agent action)
├── issues/
│   ├── 1.json          ← Maps issue #1 → its session file
│   ├── 2.json          ← Maps issue #2 → its session file
│   └── ...
└── sessions/
    ├── 2026-07-07T10-30-00_abc123.jsonl   ← Full conversation for issue #1
    ├── 2026-07-07T11-15-00_def456.jsonl   ← Full conversation for issue #2
    └── ...
```

### File Reference

| File | Purpose | Mutability | Who writes it |
|------|---------|------------|---------------|
| `memory.md` | Durable facts, preferences, decisions | Append-only | Agent (via tools) + you (manual edits) |
| `personality.md` | Agent name, vibe, emoji, hatch date | Mutable | Agent (during hatch flow + refinements) |
| `user.md` | Your name, preferences, communication style | Mutable | Agent (when it learns about you) |
| `audit.log` | Every agent run as JSON | Append-only | Lifecycle (automatic) |
| `issues/N.json` | Issue → session file mapping | Managed | Lifecycle (automatic) |
| `sessions/*.jsonl` | Full conversation transcripts | Append-only | Pi (automatic) |

### How Memory Works

At the start of every session (agent mode), the agent's prompt is built from:

1. **`state/personality.md`** — who the agent is (name, vibe, emoji)
2. **`state/user.md`** — what the agent knows about you
3. **Last 20 lines of `state/memory.md`** — recent durable facts (skips default/uninitialized content)
4. **The issue title + body** (or comment body) — what you're asking now (template boilerplate stripped)
5. **Operating instructions** — read AGENTS.md, update files, etc.
6. **Hatch trigger** (if `hatch` label present) — read BOOTSTRAP.md

The agent can also search its own history using bash tools:

```bash
# Inside an issue, the agent can run:
rg -i "search term" state/memory.md          # Search memory log
rg -i "search term" state/sessions/          # Search all past conversations
tail -30 state/memory.md                     # Recent memories
```

**Token budget management**: If the prompt exceeds 6,000 tokens, the system progressively strips context:
1. Drop "Recent Memory" section
2. Drop "About Your Human" section
3. Truncate the user message itself

This ensures the prompt always fits within Groq's free-tier limits.

### Session Tracking

**How it tracks conversations per issue:**

When you open issue #5:
1. The lifecycle checks `state/issues/5.json` for an existing mapping
2. If not found, creates a new session file: `state/sessions/2026-07-07T10-30-00_abc123.jsonl`
3. Saves the mapping: `state/issues/5.json` → `{ "issueNumber": 5, "sessionPath": "state/sessions/...jsonl", "turnCount": 1 }`
4. Commits everything to git

When you comment on issue #5 again:
1. The lifecycle reads `state/issues/5.json` → finds the session path
2. Passes `--session state/sessions/...jsonl` to pi
3. Pi loads the full prior conversation from the JSONL file
4. The agent resumes with **complete context** of everything said before
5. Updates the mapping with `turnCount: 2` and new `updatedAt` timestamp
6. Commits to git

This means: you can have a long-running conversation across many comments on the same issue, and the agent remembers every word.

**Simple chat mode** (with `chat` label) does NOT create session files — it's stateless by design to save tokens. Each chat comment is independent.

### Atomic Writes

All file writes use **atomic write** (write to a `.tmp` file, then rename). This prevents:
- Partial writes from being observed by concurrent readers
- Race conditions between concurrent git operations
- Corruption from killed processes (e.g., workflow timeout)

### Backup & Restore

Since everything is in git, backup is trivial:

```bash
# Backup
git tag backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Or just clone the repo — that IS your backup
git clone https://github.com/maruf009sultan/issueclaw.git backup

# Restore state to a previous point
git checkout backup-20260101 -- state/
git commit -m "restore state to 2026-01-01"
git push
```

---

## 🔐 Security Model

### Who Can Trigger the Agent?

Only users with `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR` association on the repo can trigger the agent. This is enforced in **two places**:

1. **Workflow `if:` condition** (in `.github/workflows/agent.yml`):
   ```yaml
   if: contains(fromJSON('["OWNER","MEMBER","COLLABORATOR"]'),
                 github.event.issue.author_association)
   ```

2. **`shouldProcessEvent()` in code** (`src/github/events.ts`)

Random internet users **cannot** trigger the agent on public repos.

### Bot Rejection

`github-actions[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, and other bots are rejected to prevent infinite loops (agent comments on its own issue → triggers itself → ...).

### Permissions

The workflow requests the minimum permissions needed:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write        # Commit & push state
  issues: write          # Comment, react, close
  actions: write         # Read workflow info
  pull-requests: write   # If PR support enabled
```

### Network Egress

The agent only makes outbound network calls to:
- **Your git remote** (github.com) — for push/pull
- **Your LLM provider** (api.groq.com, api.anthropic.com, etc.) — for inference

No other network egress by default.

### Private Repos

For anything sensitive, **make the repo private**. The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` which works for private repos with no extra setup. Note: GitHub Actions has limited free minutes for private repos (2,000/month on free tier). Public repos have unlimited minutes.

### Secret Handling

API keys are stored as GitHub secrets and injected as env vars only during the workflow run. They are **never** logged (the logger redacts anything matching `apiKey`/`secret`/`token` patterns). The agent never sees the raw key — pi reads it from `process.env` directly.

---

```

---

## 🧪 Testing

IssueClaw has **122 tests** across three layers:

| Layer | Count | What it tests |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Unit tests | 99 | Individual modules (config, providers, memory, github, agent, simple-chat, utils) |
| Integration tests | 4 | Full lifecycle with mocked pi |
| Live tests | 29 | End-to-end pipeline with real pi + mock LLM server |

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit + integration tests (fast, ~2 seconds)
bun run test

# With coverage
bun run test:coverage

# Live test (slow, ~30 seconds, uses mock LLM server)
bun run scripts/live-test.ts

# Watch mode
bun run test:watch
```

### The Live Test Harness

The live test (`scripts/live-test.ts`) is the gold standard — it:

1. Starts a mock LLM server (OpenAI-compatible) on localhost
2. Creates a temp git repo with the project files
3. Generates a fake GitHub event (issue opened)
4. Runs the **actual** `main.ts` lifecycle (no mocks of our code)
5. Runs the **actual** pi binary (no mocks of pi)
6. Pi makes real HTTP calls to the mock LLM server
7. Verifies:
   - All state files created (`memory.md`, `personality.md`, `user.md`, `audit.log`)
   - Session JSONL created with real conversation
   - Issue mapping saved
   - Audit log has `agent_run_start` + `agent_run_end` entries
   - Mock LLM received proper requests (correct model, correct message format)
   - All CLI commands work (`config show`, `memory show`, `doctor`, etc.)
8. Tests hatch label event
9. Cleans up

### CI Workflow

Every push and PR triggers `.github/workflows/ci.yml` which runs:
- `bun x tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript strict mode, no errors)
- `bun x biome check src tests scripts` (linting)
- `bun run test` (99 unit + 4 integration tests)

---

## 🐳 Docker

For local development parity with CI:

```bash
# Build
docker compose build

# Diagnose
docker compose run --rm issueclaw doctor

# Run with env vars
docker compose run --rm \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza_xxx \
  issueclaw run --dry-run
```

The `Dockerfile` uses `oven/bun:1.1-debian` and installs `git`, `gh`, `curl`, `jq`, `ripgrep`.

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability

### Audit Log

Every agent run is logged as JSON to `state/audit.log`:

```bash
# Recent activity
tail -5 state/audit.log | jq .

# All errors
jq 'select(.details.success == false)' state/audit.log

# Runs per issue
jq -s 'group_by(.details.issue) | map({issue: .[0].details.issue, count: length})' state/audit.log

# Simple chat vs agent mode
jq 'select(.action == "simple_chat_complete" or .action == "agent_run_complete")' state/audit.log
```

### Structured Logging

Set `ISSUECLAW_LOG_JSON=true` for JSON log output (compatible with Datadog, Splunk, Loki, etc.):

```json
{"ts":"2026-07-07T10:30:00.000Z","level":"info","component":"issueclaw","msg":"agent run succeeded","provider":"gemini/gemini-2.0-flash","durationMs":45230}
```

Or use colorized human-readable output (default in TTY):

```
[2026-07-07T10:30:00.000Z] INFO  [issueclaw] agent run succeeded {"provider":"gemini/gemini-2.0-flash","durationMs":45230}
```

### GitHub Actions Artifacts

Every run uploads `state/` and `/tmp/agent-raw-*.jsonl` as an artifact, retained for 30 days. Download from the Actions tab → click a run → scroll to "Artifacts".

### Scheduled Maintenance

A daily workflow (`.github/workflows/scheduled.yml`) runs `scripts/maintenance.ts` which:
- Cleans up orphaned session files (sessions with no issue mapping)
- Flags oversized sessions (>10MB, candidates for compaction)

### Q: Will it work entirely from GitHub, via issues?

**A: Yes.** The entire user-facing flow is GitHub Issues:

1. **Open an issue** → agent processes → replies as comment
2. **Comment on the issue** → agent resumes with full prior context → replies
3. **Close the issue** → agent stops responding to it

There is no web UI, no CLI for end users, no Slack integration. Just GitHub Issues. This is by design — it keeps the system dead simple and uses infrastructure you already have.

### Q: Will it use the GitHub repo itself as storage?

**A: Yes, 100%.** The repo IS the database. Everything is committed to git:

- `state/memory.md` — agent's memory log
- `state/personality.md` — agent's identity
- `state/user.md` — your profile
- `state/audit.log` — audit trail
- `state/issues/N.json` — issue → session mappings
- `state/sessions/*.jsonl` — full conversation transcripts
- Any files the agent creates/edits in your repo (code, docs, configs)

There is **no external database** (no Postgres, no Redis, no S3). If you `git clone` the repo, you have a complete backup of everything.

### Q: How does session tracking work?

**A:** Each issue gets a mapping file at `state/issues/<N>.json` that points to a session JSONL file. When you comment on an existing issue, the lifecycle:

1. Reads the mapping to find the session file path
2. Passes `--session <path>` to pi
3. Pi loads the full prior conversation from the JSONL
4. The agent resumes with complete context

This means you can have long-running conversations across many comments on the same issue. The agent remembers every word.

**Simple chat mode** (with `chat` label) does NOT use session files — it's stateless to save tokens.

### Q: Can I just chat without using the full agent?

**A: Yes!** Open an issue with the `chat` label (or use the "💬 Chat" issue template). The agent will respond directly without using tools — perfect for quick questions.

This uses **~500 tokens per message** (vs ~120,000 for full agent mode), saving 99.6% of your API quota.

### Q: What if I don't want to pay for an LLM?

**A: Use Gemini.** It has a generous free tier (1M TPM, 1,500 requests/day) and the default config uses it. Combined with GitHub Actions being free for public repos, you can run this entire system for **$0/month**.

### Q: Can multiple people use the same agent?

**A: Yes**, but only `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR` can trigger it. Add them as collaborators in repo settings. Each person's comments on an issue share the same session context.

### Q: Can I run the agent locally?

**A: Yes.** The CLI supports local testing:

```bash
bun run src/cli.ts test event issues.opened   # Generate test event
bun run src/cli.ts test lifecycle              # Run lifecycle (mock pi)
bun run scripts/live-test.ts                   # Full live test (mock LLM)
```

### Q: How do I reset the agent's memory?

**A:** Three options:

```bash
# Nuclear: delete all state
rm -rf state/
bun run src/cli.ts doctor    # Reinitializes defaults

# Selective: clear just memory.md
bun run src/cli.ts memory clear

# Surgical: edit files directly
$EDITOR state/memory.md
$EDITOR state/personality.md
git add state/ && git commit -m "reset memory" && git push
```

### Q: Can I change the agent's personality?

**A: Yes.** Open an issue with the `hatch` label to bootstrap a new identity, or edit `state/personality.md` directly:

```bash
bun run src/cli.ts personality show
$EDITOR state/personality.md
git commit -am "update personality" && git push
```

### Q: What happens if the agent fails?

**A:** The agent:

1. Tries the next provider in the fallback chain (Gemini → Cerebras → OpenRouter → ...)
2. If all providers fail, posts a **detailed error comment** with:
   - All provider attempts and their errors
   - Which providers had keys set
   - Specific troubleshooting hints based on error type
   - Collapsible diagnostics section
3. The error is logged to `state/audit.log` and the workflow's stderr
4. The 👀 reaction is still removed (in the `finally` block)
5. Session artifacts are still uploaded for debugging

### Q: How long are sessions kept?

**A: Forever** — they're in git. The daily maintenance script flags sessions >10MB for compaction, but doesn't delete them. GitHub Actions artifacts (the uploaded `state/` zip) are retained for 30 days.

### Q: Does it support pull requests?

**A: Yes.** The workflow triggers on `pull_request: opened` events too. You can ask the agent to review PRs, suggest changes, etc. (disabled by default in config — set `onPullRequest: true` to enable).

### Q: Can I use this for a team?

**A: Yes**, but consider:
- All collaborators see all conversation history (it's in git)
- Concurrency is per-issue (not per-user) — multiple people commenting on the same issue are serialized
- For sensitive data, make the repo private

---

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't respond to issues

1. Check the **Actions tab** — did the workflow run?
2. Check the workflow's `if:` condition — are you `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`?
3. Run `bun run src/cli.ts doctor` locally
4. Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or other provider key) is set in secrets

### Agent responds with error

1. Read the error comment — it now shows **all** provider attempts
2. Check `state/audit.log` for recent errors: `tail -5 state/audit.log | jq .`
3. Look at workflow logs in Actions tab
4. Run `bun run src/cli.ts doctor` to verify config

### "Provider X invalid: requires API_KEY"

This means that provider is in your config but the matching secret isn't set. The error comment will show you:
- Which providers were tried
- Which had keys (✓) and which didn't (✗)
- Exactly which secret name to set

**Fix:** Go to Settings → Secrets → add the missing `PROVIDER_API_KEY` secret.

### 413 / TPM error (token limit exceeded)

This happens when using Groq (12K TPM) for full agent mode (needs ~120K tokens).

**Fix:**
1. Switch to Gemini (1M TPM) — set `GEMINI_API_KEY` and make it default
2. Or use simple chat mode (`chat` label) — only ~500 tokens per message

### 429 / rate limit error

**Fix:**
1. Wait a minute and retry
2. Add more fallback providers
3. Check your provider's quota dashboard

### Git push fails

- The workflow auto-rebases and retries 3 times
- If still failing, check for branch protection rules that block `issueclaw[bot]`
- Manual fix: `git pull --rebase origin main && git push`

### Comment is truncated

- Responses >60,000 chars are truncated with a notice
- Full response is in the session JSONL (uploaded as artifact)
- Increase `maxCommentLength` in config (max 65,536 — GitHub's limit)

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Personal AI Assistant

Keep a personal AI assistant in your repo that remembers your preferences, projects, and context across sessions. Open issues for tasks, chat for quick questions.

```
Issue #1: "Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript"
Issue #2 (chat): "What's the syntax for a TypeScript generic constraint?"
Issue #3: "Create a new React component for a login form"
```

The agent remembers your TypeScript preference across all issues.

### Code Documentation Generator

```
Issue: "Document all the functions in src/utils.ts"
→ Agent reads the file, generates JSDoc comments, commits the changes
```

### Bug Fixer

```
Issue: "Fix the bug where the login button doesn't work on Safari"
→ Agent reads the code, identifies the issue, fixes it, commits
```

### Code Reviewer

```
Issue: "Review PR #42 and suggest improvements"
→ Agent reads the PR diff, posts a review comment
```

### Learning Companion

```
Issue (chat): "Explain how promises work in JavaScript"
→ Agent responds with a detailed explanation (only ~500 tokens)
```

### Project Bootstrapper

```
Issue: "Set up a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS in the frontend/ directory"
→ Agent creates the project structure, configures Tailwind, commits everything
```

### DevOps Assistant

```
Issue: "Create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every PR"
→ Agent creates .github/workflows/test.yml, commits it
```

### Content Writer

```
Issue: "Write a blog post about why we chose Bun over Node.js"
→ Agent researches (reads your repo), writes the post, saves it to blog/bun-vs-node.md
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Issue Templates

You can create custom issue templates that trigger specific behaviors:

```markdown
---
name: "🔬 Research"
about: "Ask the agent to research a topic"
labels: ["chat", "research"]
---

Research topic:
[What do you want to know about?]
```

The `chat` label triggers simple chat mode. The `research` label is just for organization.

### Environment-Specific Configs

Use `ISSUECLAW_CONFIG_PATH` to use different configs for different environments:

```yaml
# In workflow:
env:
  ISSUECLAW_CONFIG_PATH: ${{ vars.ISSUECLAW_CONFIG_PATH || 'issueclaw.config.json' }}
```

### Overriding Provider at Runtime

Use `ISSUECLAW_PROVIDER` and `ISSUECLAW_MODEL` env vars to override the config:

```yaml
env:
  ISSUECLAW_PROVIDER: gemini
  ISSUECLAW_MODEL: gemini-2.5-flash
```

This is useful for A/B testing different models.

### Branch-Specific Behavior

Modify the workflow to only trigger on specific branches:

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  run-agent:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && ...
```

### Custom Tools

Restrict or expand the agent's tools in config:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "tools": ["read", "bash"],          // Read-only analysis
    "excludeTools": ["edit", "write"]    // Prevent file modifications
  }
}
```

Or for full access:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "tools": [],                          // All tools
    "skills": true,                       // Enable skills
    "extensions": true                    // Enable extensions
  }
}
```

## 📖 Deep Dive: How the Agent Mode Works

### Pi Agent Architecture

IssueClaw uses [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) v0.80.3 as the agent engine. Pi provides:

1. **Tool use** — bash, read, write, edit, grep, glob, ls
2. **Session management** — JSONL transcripts with resume capability
3. **Multi-provider support** — native support for Gemini, Cerebras, Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.
4. **Streaming** — responses stream as JSONL events
5. **Extensions** — custom provider registration
6. **Skills** — reusable prompt templates

### The Agent Loop

When you open an issue in agent mode:

1. **Prompt building** — issueclaw builds a prompt with personality, memory, and instructions
2. **Pi invocation** — pi is called as a subprocess with `--mode json --session-dir state/sessions`
3. **LLM call** — pi sends the prompt + tool definitions to the LLM API
4. **Tool execution** — if the LLM requests a tool (e.g., "read src/main.ts"), pi executes it
5. **Response loop** — pi sends the tool result back to the LLM, which may request more tools
6. **Final response** — the LLM produces a text response, pi logs it as `message_end`
7. **Extraction** — issueclaw extracts the final assistant message from the JSONL
8. **Comment** — issueclaw posts the response as a GitHub issue comment

### JSONL Event Types

Pi outputs events as JSONL (one JSON object per line):

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"abc123","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"agent_start"}
{"type":"turn_start"}
{"type":"message_start","message":{"role":"user","content":[...]}}
{"type":"message_end","message":{"role":"user","content":[...]}}
{"type":"message_start","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[]}}
{"type":"tool_call","name":"bash","arguments":{"command":"ls"}}
{"type":"tool_result","name":"bash","output":"file1.txt\nfile2.txt"}
{"type":"message_end","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Here are the files..."}]}}
{"type":"turn_end"}
{"type":"agent_end"}
```

IssueClaw's `extractFinalMessage()` finds the last `message_end` with `role: "assistant"` and extracts the text content. This is critical — if we didn't filter by role, we'd return the user's message (the prompt) as the response, which was a bug we fixed in v1.2.0.

### Session Resume

When you comment on an existing issue:

1. issueclaw reads `state/issues/<N>.json` to find the session file path
2. Passes `--session <path>` to pi
3. Pi loads the full JSONL transcript
4. The LLM sees the entire conversation history
5. The agent responds with full context

This enables long-running conversations across many comments on the same issue.

---

## 📖 Deep Dive: How Simple Chat Mode Works

### Why Simple Chat?

The full agent mode uses ~120,000 tokens per message:
- Pi's system prompt: ~20,000 tokens
- Tool definitions: ~80,000 tokens
- Context (memory, personality): ~5,000 tokens
- User message: ~5,000 tokens

This blows past Groq's 12K TPM and even strains Cerebras's 60K TPM.

Simple chat mode bypasses pi entirely and calls the LLM API directly:
- Minimal system prompt: ~200 tokens
- User message: ~100 tokens
- Total: ~500 tokens (99.6% reduction)

### Implementation

The `simple-chat.ts` module:

1. **Builds a minimal system prompt** — includes personality + recent memory (last 10 lines)
2. **Builds the user message** — just the issue title + body or comment body
3. **Calls the LLM API directly** — using `fetch()`:
   - For Gemini: uses Google's native API format (`generateContent` endpoint)
   - For all others: uses OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint
4. **Provider fallback** — tries each provider in order until one succeeds
5. **Returns the response** — no tools, no file editing, no session file

### API Formats

**OpenAI-compatible (Groq, Cerebras, OpenRouter, OpenAI, custom):**

```json
POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions
Authorization: Bearer gsk_xxx

{
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant..." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?" }
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 8192
}
```

**Google Gemini (native format):**

```json
POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=AIzaSy...

{
  "contents": [
    { "role": "user", "parts": [{ "text": "What is 2+2?" }] }
  ],
  "systemInstruction": {
    "parts": [{ "text": "You are a helpful assistant..." }]
  },
  "generationConfig": {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "maxOutputTokens": 8192
  }
}
```

### Adding a New Provider

1. Create `src/providers/myprovider.ts`:

```typescript
import type { Provider, ProviderArgs } from "./types.ts";
import type { ProviderConfig } from "../config.ts";

export const myProvider: Provider = {
  type: "myprovider",

  buildArgs(config: ProviderConfig): ProviderArgs {
    const args = ["--provider", "myprovider", "--model", config.model];
    const env: Record<string, string | undefined> = {};
    if (config.apiKey) {
      env.MYPROVIDER_API_KEY = config.apiKey;
    }
    return { args, env };
  },

  validate(config: ProviderConfig): string | null {
    if (!config.model) return "MyProvider requires a model";
    if (!config.apiKey) return "MyProvider requires MYPROVIDER_API_KEY";
    return null;
  },
};
```

2. Register in `src/providers/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { myProvider } from "./myprovider.ts";
const REGISTRY = { ..., myprovider: myProvider };
```

3. Add to config schema in `src/config.ts`:

```typescript
type: z.enum(["anthropic", "openai", ..., "myprovider", "custom"]),
```

4. Add to `providerToApiKeyEnv`:

```typescript
myprovider: "MYPROVIDER_API_KEY",
```

5. Add tests in `tests/unit/providers.test.ts`

6. Add to `autoGenerateConfig()` if it has a free tier

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
bun run test

# Specific test file
bun run test tests/unit/simple-chat.test.ts

# With coverage
bun run test:coverage

# Watch mode
bun run test:watch

# Live test (end-to-end with mock LLM)
bun run scripts/live-test.ts

# Smoke test (quick environment check)
bun run scripts/smoke-test.ts
```

### Debugging

## 🔍 Comparison: Token Usage by Mode

| Scenario | Agent Mode | Simple Chat Mode |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| "What is 2+2?" | ~120,000 tokens | ~50 tokens |
| "Write a hello world HTML page" | ~120,000 tokens | ~80 tokens |
| "Explain async/await" | ~120,000 tokens | ~100 tokens |
| "Fix the bug in main.ts" | ~120,000 tokens | N/A (needs tools) |

## 🎓 Tutorial: Your First Agent Task

### Step 1: Open an issue

Go to your repo's Issues tab → New Issue → "🔧 Task" template.

Title: `Create a hello world HTML page`

Body:
```
Create a simple hello world HTML page at index.html with:
- A heading saying "Hello World"
- Basic CSS styling
- A footer with the current year
```

### Step 2: Watch the agent work

1. Within seconds, the agent reacts with 👀
2. Go to the Actions tab to see the workflow running
3. The agent will:
   - Read the issue
   - Use bash to create `index.html`
   - Write the HTML content
   - Commit and push
4. After ~30-60 seconds, the agent posts a comment:

```markdown
I've created `index.html` with a hello world page. Here's what I did:

1. Created `index.html` with a heading, CSS styling, and footer
2. Committed the changes

The file is now in your repo at `index.html`.
```

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
git pull
cat index.html
```

You should see the HTML file the agent created.

### Step 4: Continue the conversation

Comment on the issue:
```
Add a button that shows an alert when clicked
```

The agent will resume the session (it remembers creating index.html) and add the button.

## 🎓 Tutorial: Your First Chat

### Step 1: Open a chat issue

Go to Issues → New Issue → "💬 Chat" template.

Title: `What is closure in JavaScript?`

Body:
```
Can you explain what a closure is in JavaScript with an example?
```

### Step 2: Get a fast response

Within ~5 seconds (vs ~60 seconds for agent mode), the agent responds:

```markdown
A closure is a function that remembers the variables from its outer scope,
even after the outer function has returned.

Here's an example:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

In this example, the inner function "closes over" the `count` variable...
```

### Step 3: Check the cost

This chat used ~500 tokens (vs ~120,000 for agent mode). You can verify in the audit log:

```bash
tail -1 state/audit.log | jq .
```

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-07-07T...",
  "action": "simple_chat_complete",
  "details": {
    "issue": 7,
    "success": true,
    "durationMs": 4200,
    "provider": "gemini",
    "tokensUsed": 487,
    "responseLength": 892
  }
}
```

## 🎓 Tutorial: Hatching a Personality

### Step 1: Open a hatch issue

Go to Issues → New Issue → "🥚 Hatch" template.

Title: `Hatch`

Body: (leave default)

### Step 2: Have a conversation

The agent will respond with something like:

```markdown
Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?

I don't have a name yet, a vibe, or an emoji. Let's figure that out together.

What should we call me?
```

Reply with:

```
Your name is Buddy. You're a chill, helpful assistant. Your emoji is 🤖.
My name is Maruf.
```

### Step 3: The agent updates its identity

The agent will:

1. Update `state/personality.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Personality

   ## Name
   Buddy

   ## Nature
   Chill, helpful assistant

   ## Vibe
   Casual and friendly

   ## Emoji
   🤖

   ## Hatch Date
   2026-07-07
   ```

2. Update `state/user.md`:
   ```markdown
   # User Profile

   ## Name
   Maruf
   ```

3. Commit and push these changes

4. Reply:
   ```markdown
   Got it! I'm Buddy 🤖. Nice to meet you, Maruf!

   I've updated my personality and noted your name. From now on, I'll remember this across all our conversations.
   ```

### Step 4: Verify persistence

```bash
git pull
cat state/personality.md
cat state/user.md
```

Now, every time you open a new issue, the agent will introduce itself as Buddy 🤖 and know your name is Maruf.

## ❓ Extended FAQ

### Q: Can I use this without GitHub Actions?

**A:** The agent is designed for GitHub Actions, but you can run it locally:

```bash
# Set up environment
export GITHUB_EVENT_PATH=/tmp/event.json
export GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=issues
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
export GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...

# Create a test event
echo '{"action":"opened","issue":{"number":1,"title":"Test","body":"Hello","user":{"login":"you"},"author_association":"OWNER","labels":[]}}' > /tmp/event.json

# Run the lifecycle
bun run src/lifecycle/main.ts
```

### Q: Can I use this with GitLab or Bitbucket?

**A:** Not directly — it relies on GitHub-specific features (Issues, Actions, `gh` CLI). But the core agent logic is portable. You'd need to:
1. Replace `src/github/client.ts` with a GitLab/Bitbucket API client
2. Replace `src/github/events.ts` with GitLab/Bitbucket event parsing
3. Replace the GitHub Actions workflow with GitLab CI / Bitbucket Pipelines

### Q: How do I delete old sessions?

**A:** Sessions are in git, so you can't "delete" them (git preserves history). But you can remove the files:

```bash
rm state/sessions/old-session.jsonl
rm state/issues/1.json
git add -A && git commit -m "cleanup old sessions" && git push
```

The daily maintenance script also flags orphaned sessions (sessions with no issue mapping).

### Q: Can I use multiple repos with one agent?

**A:** Currently no — each repo has its own agent. Multi-repo support is on the roadmap.

### Q: How do I backup everything?

**A:** The repo IS the backup. Just clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maruf009sultan/issueclaw.git backup
```

Or use git tags:

```bash
git tag backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Q: Can the agent access the internet?

**A:** In agent mode, the agent has the `bash` tool, so it can `curl` URLs. But GitHub Actions runners have standard internet access. The agent can:
- Read web pages (via curl)
- Download files
- Access APIs

But it cannot:
- Open a browser
- Execute JavaScript in a browser context
- Access localhost services (unless you set them up)

### Q: How do I monitor the agent's activity?

**A:** Several ways:

1. **GitHub Actions tab** — see workflow runs, logs, artifacts
2. **`state/audit.log`** — JSON audit trail of every run
3. **Issue comments** — the agent posts its responses as comments
4. **Git log** — every commit shows what changed
5. **Structured logs** — set `ISSUECLAW_LOG_JSON=true` for log aggregation

### Q: Can I limit the agent's access?

**A:** Yes, via config:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "tools": ["read", "grep", "ls"],     // Read-only
    "excludeTools": ["bash", "edit", "write"]  // No modifications
  }
}
```

This makes the agent a read-only analyst.

### Q: What if the agent goes rogue?

**A:** Several safeguards:

1. **Timeouts** — 30-min job + 15-min agent timeout
2. **Permission checks** — only authorized users can trigger
3. **Audit log** — every action is logged
4. **Git history** — all changes are versioned, you can revert
5. **Branch protection** — protect `main` branch, require PR reviews
6. **Tool restrictions** — limit tools to read-only if paranoid

### Q: Can I use this commercially?

**A:** Yes! It's MIT licensed. Use it however you want.
